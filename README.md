## Running your project

The generated project includes a development server on port `8080`, which will rebuild the app whenever you change application code. To start the server (with the dev-tools enabled), run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

To run the server with the dev-tools disabled, run:

```bash
$ DEBUG=false npm start
```

To build for production, this command will output optimized production code:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
